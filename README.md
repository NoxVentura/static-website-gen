# Static Website Generator - The Terrible, No Good, Very Bad Generator

A static site generator takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) and turns them into a static website of HTML and CSS files. Static sites are quite popular for blogs and other content-heavy websites because they're lightning-fast, secure, and easy to host.

A static site is what it sounds like... **static**. No matter who is interacting with the site, the content is always the same.
